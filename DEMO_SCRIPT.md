- Show the carbon breakdown: "Saved 0.42g CO₂ - 78% reduction"
- Mention: "Sorcer finds the most sustainable energy source in real-time"

---

### 2. **Semantic Cache Hit** (20 seconds)
**Action:** Ask a similar question to trigger cache

**Prompt:**
```
How does data center location affect AI carbon emissions?
```

**What to highlight:**
- **INSTANT** response with cache celebration popup
- Zero compute, zero carbon
- "This answer was served from our shared semantic cache"
- Click carbon breakdown to show "0g CO₂ - Instant Processing"

---

### 3. **Agentic Tool Usage** (45 seconds)
**Action:** Trigger the agentic workflow

**Prompt:**
```
Build me a Python script that calculates the carbon savings from using renewable energy data centers
```

**What to highlight:**
- Watch the multi-step agentic process
- Code generation with carbon-aware comments
- Mention: "The agent breaks down complex tasks and routes each step optimally"
- Show the final code output with carbon metadata

---

### 4. **Ledger Page** (30 seconds)
**Action:** Click "Ledger" in sidebar

**What to show:**
- Scroll through chat history
- Point out carbon savings per conversation
- Highlight the running total: "24.8kg CO₂ saved across 1,420 prompts"
- Show compression ratios and cache hits
- Mention: "Every conversation is tracked and optimized"

---

### 5. **Map Visualization** (25 seconds)
**Action:** Click "Map" in sidebar

**What to show:**
- Real-time US energy grid visualization
- Point to green regions (high renewable %) vs red regions (fossil fuel heavy)
- Show data center locations with CFE percentages
- Mention: "Sorcer routes to the cleanest available data center based on real-time grid data"
- Hover over regions to show carbon intensity

---

### 6. **Profile Page** (35 seconds)
**Action:** Click "Profile" in sidebar

**What to highlight:**
- **Sustainability Score** ring at top (e.g., 87/100)
- Big stats: "24.8kg CO₂ saved, 1,420 prompts, 72% avg reduction"
- Georgia map showing Atlanta → data centers with routing animation
- Grid facts: "60% fossil fuel, 5% of state power goes to data centers"
- Scroll to badges/achievements
- Mention: "Track your personal impact and earn sustainability badges"

---

### 7. **Developer/Semantic Cache Page** (30 seconds)
**Action:** Click "Cache" or "Developer" in sidebar

**What to show:**
- Community cache stats: "14,000+ entries, 68% hit rate"
- Projected impact: "14.2kg CO₂ saved, 384K tokens recycled"
- Explain: "The semantic cache is shared across all users"
- Show cache clusters visualization
- Mention: "Similar queries get instant responses with zero compute"
- Point out "Projected / Estimated" labels

---

### 8. **Voice Mode** (40 seconds)
**Action:** Click microphone icon in SpellBar

**What to do:**
1. Say: **"Hey Sorcer, what do you do?"**
   - Listen to response about finding sustainable energy sources
   
2. Say: **"What's 25 times 4?"**
   - Get instant answer: "25 × 4 equals 100. By the way, this was served from cache — zero carbon used."
   
3. Say: **"Tell me about Georgia's data centers"**
   - Hear about Google in Douglas County, Meta in Newton County
   
4. Say: **"Bye"**
   - Watch it say goodbye and close automatically

**What to highlight:**
- Voice responses are short and relevant
- Powered by ElevenLabs TTS
- Can answer ANY question, not just carbon topics
- "Bye" command to close

---

### 9. **Return Home & Closing** (15 seconds)
**Action:** Click "Sorcer" logo or "Home" in sidebar

**Final message to camera:**
> "Sorcer makes AI sustainable without compromising on quality. Every prompt is routed to the cleanest energy source, cached for instant reuse, and tracked for transparency. It's not about doing less — it's about being smarter with how we compute."

**End screen:** Homepage with tagline visible
> "Powered by Sorcer — finding the most sustainable energy sources in real-time"

## 🎯 Key Talking Points Throughout

- **"Sorcer finds the most sustainable energy source"** (not just routing)
- **Real-time carbon intelligence** - not static, adapts to grid conditions
- **Semantic caching** - shared community benefit, zero compute
- **Transparency** - every query tracked with carbon metadata
- **No compromise** - same quality, lower carbon
- **Georgia-specific** - local data centers, local impact

## 💡 Pro Tips for Recording

1. **Clear your chat history** before starting for a clean demo
2. **Have backend running** for real responses (or use dummy mode)
3. **Slow down** when showing carbon breakdowns - let viewers read
4. **Pause on visualizations** - let animations complete
5. **Use voice mode last** - it's a great "wow" moment
6. **Practice the "bye" command** - smooth exit is important
